# HealthFit
ios app 

Name: Eanguy Eng

This will be a health and fitness app.
It is created to help the people who wants to start the journey to achieve their goal.
This app can calculate your BMI which will allow you to set your goals.
This app also contain fitness training provided by my experience.
It will show how to train each style that is recommended by the time I've spent in the gym.
This is a solo project, so I do not know how much I could accomplish, but it will give the idea
of what I could add on it in the future, if I want to continue making it better.

To start the project

First: Clone the project 

Second: open terminal

Third: locate the file you clone

Fourth: open HealthFit.xcworkspace

Fifth: run the project on ios 14.5 iphone 12 pro max

After you run the project you will see three icon. 

Check BMI

Arm

Burn Fat(Empty view controller)

These are all buttons. In Arm you will see another 3 icons.

Bicep

Tricep

Deltoid(Empty View Controller)

The button bicep and tricep are working. It has steps and videos that I create to show how to
do each exercise to build that certain part of the muscle.

This app is a work in progress. 

I created a youtube account and made videos for each exercise that was put into this app. It will show
the user on how to do each exercise the right way.

The check bmi view controller has improved. It won't crash when the text field are empty. It
will request user to fill in all the field. It will take the information calculate the BMI and
caloric intake that based on the person's gender, height, weight, and age.
