# HealthFit
ios app 

Name: Eanguy Eng
This will be a health and fitness app.
It is created to help the people who wants to start the journey to achieve their goal.
This app can calculate your BMI which will allow you to set your goals.
This app also contain fitness training provided by my experience.
It will show how to train each style that is recommended by the time I've spent in the gym.
This is a solo project, so I do not know how much I could accomplish, but it will give the idea
of what I could add on it in the future, if I want to continue making it better.

To start the project
first: Clone the project 
second: open terminal
third: locate the file you clone
fourth: open HealthFit.xcworkspace
fifth: run the project

After you run the project you will see three icon. 
Check BMI
Arm
Burn Fat
These are all buttons. Check BMI and Arm are working. In Arm you will see another 3 icons.
Bicep
Tricep
Deltoid
The button bicep and tricep are working. It has steps and videos that I create to show how to
do each exercise to build that certain part of the muscle.
This app is a work in progress. There are alot of things left to add on.
